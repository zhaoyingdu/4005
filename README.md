This matrix represent the node trasitions inside the network we are modeling, 
the avaiable nodes are: 
  three source nodes(c1,c2,c3): dispatching jobs to inspectors
  two inspector node(i1,i2): receiving jobs from source nodes and dispacthing them to machine nodes
  three machine nodes(m1,m2,m3): receiving jobs from inspector node and dispatching them to sink nodes
  sink nodes(p1,p2,p3): out put node of this net work.   

use ki,j represent's an element in the matrix, then:
  ki,j = . means transition never happens from node i to node j
  0< ki,j < 1 means transition can happen from node i to node j with certain probability,
    if the number is 1, means next transtion will happen from node i to node j for sure.
    (for example, both kc2,i2 and kc3,i2 equals 0.5, representing the fact that inspector 2
    picks randomly from c2 and c3)
  ki,j = x, means the probality of a particular route be taken depends on other conditions when then network
    starts. In this model, the three x's in row i1 meaning the probability on how inspector 1 dispatching finished
    component depend on the queueing disipline we choose.  

Buffers in the netWork:
  c1_m1: of queue size 2, getting push event from i1, pop event from m1
  c1_m2: of queue size 2, getting push event from i1, pop event from m2
  c1_m3: of queue size 2, getting push event from i1, pop event from m3
  c2_m2: of queue size 2, getting push event from i2, pop event from m2
  c3_m3: of queue size 2, getting push event from i2, pop event from m3
  These buffers can not be represented in the matrix, therefore they are explicitly described here. Their states 
  determine the network's state

Event flow and state transition for each stateful node/buffer(note the system is concurrent, so I made use of wait and signal)

MISC(Iteration 1 and iteration4)
iteration4:
Alternative queue disipline for inspector1.
name: machine_2 and machine_3 first
design goal: increase the throughput by reducing the occurrance of inspector2 being blocked, 
or more explicitly, try to reduce the occurrance of following to senarios:
  senario 1:
    inspector2: blocking after processing component2
    machine2: c2_m2 is full, c1_m2 is empty
    machine3: 
      (best case senario) not idle, c3_m3 and c1_m3 are both non-empty
      (worst case senario) idle, c3_m3 and c1_m3 are empty
  senario 2:
    inspector2: blocking after processing component3
    machine3: c3_m3 is full, c1_m3 is empty
    machine2: 
      (best case senario) not idle, c2_m2 and c1_m2 are both non-empty
      (worst case senario) idle, c2_m2 and c1_m2 are empty
reasoning:
  ging m1 higher priority over machine2 and machine3 can result in machine2, machine3 have more
  chances t idle and inspector2 has more chances to block. Therefore, in theis concurrent syatem, 
  m2, m3 and i2 would have little uptime ratio comparing to i1 and m1
  If we give m2 and m3 higher priority over m1, only m1's uptime would be adversely affected,
  but i1 would have same uptime ratio as before, and m2, m3 and i2 will have higher uptime ratio. 
implementation:
  when inspector checking for available buffer to dispatch job, it will check buffer patterns in the following
  order:
  priority-1:
    machine 2 or machine 3 who is idle waiting for only component1
    c1_m2 = 0 AND c2_m2 !=0  or c1_m3 = 0 AND c3_m3 !=0
    if found, dispatch to corresponding c1's buffer
  priority-2:
    machine 2 or machine 3 who has both buffer empty
    c1_m2 = 0 AND c2_m2 =0  or c1_m3 = 0 AND c3_m3 = 0
    if found, dispatch to corresponding c1's buffer
  priority 3:
    c1_m1 is empty
    if true dispatch to c1_m1
  default:
    use default principle stated in question
